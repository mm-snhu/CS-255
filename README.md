SNHU CS-255-R1994 - System Analysis and Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
 - The client DriverPass wants to provide students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road training to better prepare them for driving tests. DriverPass wants our consulting company’s help in designing a system that can handle these needs. There is a need for better driver training. So many people fail their driving tests at the DMV, so DriverPass hopes to take advantage of the void in the market when in comes to training students for the driving test. DriverPass wants customers to be able to take online classes and practice tests. DrivePass will also provide customers with on-the-road training if they wish. The built system needs to handle all of this. 

What did you do particularly well?
 - Through discussions with other teammates, we were able to come up with a satisfactory design of the system. This was accomplished by creating various models that focused on different design considerations. Models included UML Use Case Diagrams, UML Activity Diagrams, UML Sequence Diagrams, and UML Class Diagrams. Organization is key to any project, so we also created Gantt Charts to map the steps and timeline of our project to meet the client's needs on time. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
 - I would improve the documents by adding an additional interation step that involved the client again. The designs were based on an intial interview with the DriverPass clients. As we were making the designs, there were many followup questions that could have been answered through a second interview with the client. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
 - The interview we had with the client let us know about the different users, their roles, permissions, and needed functions. This information, together with having the purpose and background of the project in mind helped meet the user's needs. It's it so important to consider the user's needs when designing because after we are done with building the project, they will be the one's using it needs to work for them. Otherwise we could potentially have to return to make a large amount of work on the project, costing additional time and money.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
 - DriverPass was a good learning experience to take a request of a client and design a software system for it. The interview with the client gave a lot detail and it was useful to read everything provided. In future designs I make, I'll make sure they include a similar meeting to get as much details as possible. 
 - As we made designs, we shared them with other teammembers and they gave feedback of ways to improve it which also helped in improving our designs. In future designs I make, I'll make sure my teammates can have the opportunity to give each other feedback on our designs. 
 - No model was all-encompassing, so we made various different models to capture all the important overviews of the system. Using the different models is helpful to think about items that might have not been conisdered before, so in future designs I make, I'll make use of the various models as tools for my designing.
